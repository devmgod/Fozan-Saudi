As you can see here, almost companies in the world choose JavaScript and Python(Express, Django...) because of website security and loading speed. I think.
And most important thing is that Js and Python are fast growing languages as backend. 
If you build your company website using this, you will be easy to update and maintain the website with strong security and fast speed.
So finally, I recommend you to choose JavaScript or Python (Express, Django, Flask as framework).
